# Information Theory with Python

This project contains Python implementations for **Lab 01** and **Lab 02**, organized into separate modules.

## Folder Structure

* **`lab01/`**: Contains scripts for Information and Entropy.
    * `information.py`: Calculates Self-Information.
    * `entropy.py`: Calculates Shannon Entropy.
    * `joint_probs.py`: Computes joint probabilities (Rain/Wind).
* **`lab02/`**: Contains source coding algorithms.
    * `huffman.py`: Huffman Coding.
    * `fano.py`: Shannon-Fano Coding.
    * `elias.py`: Shannon-Fano-Elias Coding.
* **`main.py`**: The main executable script that imports from the folders and runs the assignments.

## How to Run

1.  Open your terminal/command prompt in the root directory (where `main.py` is).
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
